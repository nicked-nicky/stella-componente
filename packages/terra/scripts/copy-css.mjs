 * Comment stripping mirrors tsc's own `removeComments` (see
 * tsconfig.json): src/ keeps every design-rationale comment in full —
 * they're the reason this codebase is maintainable — dist/ just
 * doesn't ship them as bytes. tokens.css alone is ~59% comments by
 * measured weight, so this isn't a rounding error.
